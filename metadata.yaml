description: "A Daughter of the Snows (1902) is Jack London's first novel. Set in\
  \ the Yukon, it tells the story of Frona Welse, \"a Stanford graduate and physical\
  \ Valkyrie\" who takes to the trail after upsetting her wealthy father's community\
  \ by her forthright manner and befriending the town's prostitute. She is also torn\
  \ between love for two suitors: Gregory St Vincent, a local man who turns out to\
  \ be cowardly and treacherous; and Vance Corliss, a Yale-trained mining engineer.\n\
  The novel is noteworthy for its strong and self-reliant heroine, one of many who\
  \ would people his fiction. Her name echoes that of his mother, Flora Wellman, though\
  \ her inspiration has also been said to include London's friend Anna Strunsky.\n\
  Modern commentators have criticized the novel for its approval of the main character's\
  \ view that Anglo-Saxons are racially superior.\nThe novel was commissioned by publisher\
  \ S. S. McClure, who provided London a $125 a month stipend to write it.\n From\
  \ Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
